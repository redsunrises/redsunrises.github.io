			<h1>Out of the Darkness Walk for Suicide Prevention</h1>
				<img src="ood.png" class="center">
				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>In one of my Bible classes, we had to participate in volunteer work. I don't recall if it was a certain number of hours, or just one major event, but my volunteer work was the Out of the Darkness Suicide Prevention Walk. I helped set up the event, and I believe I helped people sign into the event or get their t-shirts and/or bracelets. I also participated in the walk itself. I might have helped guide the walk, or carried the banner, I don't recall.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The Out of the Darkness walk was an interesting event. It was kind of dark and sad, because suicide is a dark and sad topic, and most of the people there had known somebody who had taken their own life. I had known a person who had died in such a way in high school. I wasn't particularly close to the person, but it was still a sad event. Yet the walk was also happy, because it was a bunch of people coming together to raise awareness for an issue that had affected them, and they were trying to contribute in some way to decreasing the issue in the future. Seeing people try to solve the problems that plague society is always a happy occasion.</p>
