			<h1>Living History Weekend at the Museum of the American G.I.</h1>
				<img src="wwii.jpg" class="center">
				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Every year, the Museum of the American G.I. in College Station, Texas hosts Living History Museum, which is a large event in which WWII collectors from all over the state and nation bring their WWII replicas and authentic gear to show off. There are real tanks, replica camps for both Axis and Allies, reenactors dressed in period clothing, and other enthusiasts and tourists all over the place. It is a fun event for those interested in history. They had WWI trenches that visitors could tour, and the main event is a reenactment of one of the battles of WWII.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I initially went because I had several friends that were reenactors participating in the event, and they invited me. It sounded cool and like a good opportunity to visit some friends I don't often see, so I took the road trip down to College Station. It was significant for many reasons, among them being that I had never been to College Station before, nor had I ever driven as far as College Station before without my parents. I enjoy road trips, and managed to find my way without getting totally lost in the process. I had to figure out how to navigate College Station, which was tough, but I managed just fine. It ended up being a lot of fun and I gained a lot of experience in being independent.</p>
