			<h1>Final Ethics Paper</h1>
				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Unfortunately, I do not have a picture for this assignment. I did this assignment on an older computer. In my Ethics class, we filled out a form with various topics with our stances to those topics. Topics included gay marriage, recreational drug use, gun rights, etc., and the stances ranged from "strongly for" to "strongly against". Unbeknownst to us, this was a trap. Our final paper was to be over a topic of the professor's choosing, but we had to argue the opposite side than we had chosen on the paper. The purpose was for us to exercise our ability to see opposing points of view and learn how to apply Ethics to situations from a less-biased perspective. Additionally, the professor had had complaints that he graded papers poorly because he disagreed with the student's point of view, and he was doing this to protect himself, because even we disagree with ourselves.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This paper presented an interesting challenge. I challenged myself even more to not use the arguments that my oponents usually used, but to try to use a novel argument against it that I might even be able to agree with. It certainly leaves a bad taste in one's mouth when they are forced to regurgitate words that have a bitter flavor to them, so to try to sweeten my words for my own sake and not sound like I was being sarcastic or lying, I tried to take the argument in a different direction. I ended up getting a good grade on the paper and the professor agreed that my argument was novel and he seemed pleased with the way I presented it.</p>
