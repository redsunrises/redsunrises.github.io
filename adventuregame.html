				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The Adventure Game was a small, text based adventure game written in Prolog for my Programming Languages class my sophomore year.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Programming Languages was an interesting class. We learned a lot of languages that may not necessarily be extraordinarily useful in and of themselves, but they were fun to use and required different ways of thinking than most languages. This was true of Prolog. It is a useful language for AI, and it is relatively simple to use. So much happens on the interpreter level, the programmer doesn't really have to think about all the nitty-gritty details about how to make a program work. You say that a cave exists, and it is so. You say it is connected to another cave, and it happens.</p>
