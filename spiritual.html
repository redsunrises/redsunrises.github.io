			<h1>Spiritual Reflection</h1>
				<p>I have grown a lot spiritually while here at ACU, but I'm not sure all of it is because of ACU. I've gone to church consistently for all of my life, and my church has had some interesting classes and events since I've been in college. I haven't attended Chapel as often as ACU would have liked me to, partly because of work, and partly because of apathy. I'm frankly not a fan of ACU's chapels, with the exception of some of the small group chapels. Granted, the small group chapels I've attended have generally been an enriching experience, often with unique viewpoints on the Bible.</p>
				<p>I think the greatest impact ACU has had on my spirituality has been from professors, rather than Chapel. Not just in Bible classes either, although those have certainly helped me grow, but the way that many ACU professors work Christianity into any topic they're teaching, which must be very challenging in some subjects, as they may seem to be totally unrelated to Christianity.</p>
				<p>I tend to be of the opinion that exploring other religions or simply other forms of Christianity can have a profound impact on the way that one approaches their own view of Christianity. I have explored other religions while here and found some remarkable similarities between Christianity and some Pagan religions, like the fact that almost every religion in the world has a flood narrative, the Celts worshipped a carpenter god named Hesus, one of the names of Odin is Herjafather, which translates to "father of hosts" and is similar to the name "Lord of Hosts", etc. I try to keep an open mind and not just arrogantly believe that what I've been taught my whole life is the only possibility for truth; if people can be converted, that leaves open the possibility that what one has always been taught might not be correct, and in matters of the soul, it is vital that one is correct. I still tend to agree mostly with the doctrines of the Church of Christ, but I also think some of the disagreements various denominations have with each other are trivial and do more harm than good. <a href="army.html">I mentioned that I explored LDS while in Basic Training</a>, and my Mormon friend told me that if I earnestly prayed to God to reveal the truth to me, He would tell me whether the Book of Mormon was true or not. Certainly, the stories contained within it are interesting to consider, and I appreciate how family-centric LDS is.</p>
				<p><a href="army.html">I mentioned that I grew substantially at BCT</a>. There have been a lot of challenges here at ACU, and I have prayed about many of them, and perhaps that has produced the most spiritual growth of all. It is fantastic to be surrounded by Christianity all the time, but I also have questioned just how Christian ACU is at times, when the tuition is practically usury. However, ACU has presented me with a lot of unique opportunities, to interact with conflicting views of Christianity, to learn more about the Bible, to have something to pray about, and to allow me to meet some great people, both among my peers and my professors. At the very least, it's better than going to one of those heathen secular universities ;)</p>
