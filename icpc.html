			<h1>Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest</h1>

				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>One year, ACU's chapter of ACM hosted a programming contest at ACU that, if memory serves, was a regional portion of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, attended by teams from several other colleges. I participated in the event on a team with Kevin and Sebastian, I believe. We were team #babygroot.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I don't believe my team did particularly well in this contest, we may have placed decently among our peers, but it was at no credit to myself. I am a decent programmer, I suppose, but not good at competitions. I competed in UIL Computer Science competitions in high school (with Sebastian, as we went to the same school), but I didn't do that great in them. Still, I like to participate in programming contests every now and then, because nothing says "fun" like staring at a computer for 5 hours, racking one's brain to come up with solutions to a series of problems. Especially when 5 hours is a long time, but not long enough. Don't mistake my sarcasm for insincerity though, the ACM ICPC was a fun event. Actually, now that I think about it, I don't think I participated in it as a member of ACM club, but rather Sebastian invited me to the Contest Programming class. Anyways, it was an interesting experience.</p>
