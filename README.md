This is a clock made with Javascript.

The features of the clock include:
  - smoothly moving second, minute, and hour hands
  - 24 hours instead of 12
  - accurate time displayed in 24 hours
  - hours are labeled
  - beautiful Courier font
  - the face changes color to reflect the time
    - red is 255 x hour / 24
    - green is 255 x hour / 60
    - blue is 255 x hour / 60
    (This way, the color is always proportional to the time and you get a wide variety of hues)
   - milliseconds since 1/1/70 is displayed near enough to real-time that the human eye probably can't tell if it's off by a bit
   - the hands actually change color to reflect their individual component of the face color

This was a concept clock I made for fun, I thought it would be interesting to explore telling time in so many ways.
I had also seen rgb clocks that I didn't like as much, and I wanted to see if I could improve the concept.
If you know how to get a chime to work, I would love to get a chime to play every hour. If I could do a short custom song for a chime, that would be fantastic.
