			<h1>Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training</h1>
				<img src="ordnance.png" class="center">
				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>I joined the Army in June, and went to BCT and AIT August-January. Basic Combat Training is a very psychologically and physically stressful event, designed to strengthen those with the mettle to stick through it, and to weed out the ones without. It involves a lot of strict rules, physical activities, and training designed to transform civilians into disciplined, fit soldiers, with the skills to kill the enemy and save their battle buddies. It involves several hours of marksmanship training, a trip through a chamber of CS gas to build confidence in equipment (specifically gas masks), three field training exercises that involve tactical training in the woods, and three ruck marches of increasing difficulty. Advanced Individual Training has more privileges, fewer rules (although still several), and is less physically intensive. There is a bit less focus on combat than BCT. Instead, the emphasis is on learning skills necessary to perform one's Military Occupational Specialty.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I went to Ft. Benning, GA for BCT, and it is often regarded as one of the toughest BCTs. I don't know if that is necessarily true, but I survived. It was tough, and while there were some good experiences, I would prefer not to repeat them if it can be avoided. As one of my Drill Sergeants said, "Basic Training is the kind of fun you only want to have once." I made a lot of friends, and I would say I grew a lot closer to God in the process, because it is in times of greatest trials that we lean on God the most. I remember one time, during one of the Field Training Exercises, I was very tired and very hot, and I thought I was out of water in my hydration system. I prayed that it would rain and that God would somehow magically make water appear in my hydration system. It turns out the bladder of the hydration system, which I was carrying in my ruck sack, was sideways, and all of the water had run to the opposite end from the hose. I still had water left. Shortly after I discovered that, it started raining, and I remembered my prayer. I chuckled, and realized that perhaps God's way of making water "magically appear" in my hydration system was just for me to realize that it had never been empty. He had answered my prayers. I attended Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints services while there, to take advantage of the opportunity to experience new things and learn about other strains of Christianity. One of my best friends from Basic was a Mormon, so I went with him. The LDS services were actually more similar to Church of Christ services than the Protestant services there, in my opinion. At AIT in Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, there were actually Church of Christ services for me to attend, so I chose to do so, and they were much more familiar to me. Regrettably, because AIT wasn't quite as challenging as BCT, I began to slack on my prayer life. However, I remembered to pray every now and then and I grew physically and mentally stronger, and learned a lot about Construction Equipment Repair, which is my MOS. I was even the Distinguished Honor Graduate, because I had the highest average at the end of the course (of all of the written tests we took, I only missed one question). Because of that, I earned the Army Achievement Medal. I suppose technically this event is more representative of my time away from ACU, since I took off a semester for it, but it is certainly a major event that happened between Freshman year and graduation, and joining the Army was a decision I had thought about for a long time since I began college.</p>
