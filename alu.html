				<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The 8-bit ALU was made in Logisim, a program used to simulate circuit boards. It was a project in my Computer Organization class. It consisted of, for me, about 18 different components of varying complexity working together. Functions are selected by 8-bit binary input, and the output is returned in 8-bit binary.</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun and challenging project. There were a lot of components to think about, and sometimes it was difficult to organize the connections from one component to the next, for some of the more complicated boards. It was very satisfying to complete.</p>
