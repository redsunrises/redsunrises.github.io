			<h2>The Clock Project</h2>
			<p>I created this clock for fun during my freshman year with a friend's help. I put it on a github.io page and decided to use that page to host my Portfolio Project, rather than trying to create a new website. The clock uses Javascript and some CSS for style. I don't count this among my required artifacts, but I thought it would help make the home page more interesting. The clock tells time in milliseconds since 0:00 1/1/70, RGB (the red component corrosponds to the hours, the green to the minutes, and the blue to the seconds), and 24hr analog. I even wrote in code to make the hands move smoothly, rather than ticking (technically they just tick every millisecond, but it looks smooth). I used this project as an example of web development experience to help me get a job at Wildcat Software my Sophomore year.</p>
