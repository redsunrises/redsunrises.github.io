			<h1>Academic Reflection</h1>
				<p>I have learned a lot of skills at ACU that will be useful to me through the rest of my life. I have learned about how computers work from the inside out, I have learned multiple programming languages, I have learned how to make mobile apps and web pages, and I have learned how to work as a Software Engineer.</p>
				<p>It would be unfortunate to study at a liberal arts university and not take advantage of the opportunity to learn other disciplines, to just get your generals over with as quickly as possible and get to the major stuff immediately. Luckily, I have had several non-CS classes that I have enjoyed, and I had hoped to get as many as 3 minors while I'm here, which I had calculated would be possible if I took the greatest advantage of Block Tuition and worked hard. Due to taking off a semester to attend Army Initial Entry Training, I don't know if I'll be able to fit one of the minors in, but I can probably still make the other two work. I have a Computational Theory concentration, which basically comes with a Math minor, and I had enough credits from High School Dual Credit class that I only lack about 6 hours to a History Minor. I want to learn at least one more language, and I'm not a fan of Romance languages and what they've done to English, so I want to get a German minor; however, it may not work out in the end. Nevertheless, I will learn what I can from the German classes I can take.</p>
				<p>I have taken Speech, American Literature After 1900, Ethics, several Bible classes, and a few German classes, none of which are CS classes. However, they have forced me to learn new skills and to think in different ways, and they have been interesting and fun experiences. I made friends from beyond the sphere of technology in those classes. I discovered that I am fascinated with linguistics in general, not just computer languages.</p>
				<p>I have also had jobs at ACU that I learned just as much, if not more, from than I would have any class. I worked at Team55 for 2 years and learned a lot about fixing computers, especially problems that specifically plague ACU. Most of the friends I made initially were from work, and I spent a lot of time at Team55 outside of my work hours. The pay wasn't great, and sometimes the work was tedius, but the experience was invaluable. I also worked for Wildcat Software for a little while and learned a lot about web development (I hadn't taken any formal Web Dev classes yet). I learned what it's like to be in a field in which work is not guaranteed. At many businesses, if customers don't want your services, you don't get money, and it doesn't matter that you have a job. WS was luckily busy enough that I didn't really have to worry about that, but at Team55, work was guaranteed, because computers always break. Construction happens everywhere, and there are always construction vehicles breaking, so with the knowledge I've gained from the Army, I will always have work if I can't find a software development job. Job stability is a very important thing.</p>
